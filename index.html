        <p>The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area, covering approximately 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers). It spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west, with diverse geographical features including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Major mountain ranges: The Rocky Mountains in the west and the Appalachian Mountains in the east</li>
          <li>Vast interior plains: The Great Plains and the Central Lowlands</li>
          <li>Major river systems: The Mississippi-Missouri river system, the Colorado River, and the Columbia River</li>
          <li>Varied climate zones: From arctic conditions in Alaska to tropical climates in Hawaii and Florida</li>
          <li>Significant natural resources: Petroleum, natural gas, coal, timber, and various minerals</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>The United States has a population of over 330 million people, making it the third most populous country in the world. Its demographic profile reflects centuries of immigration and internal migration patterns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ethnic Diversity:</strong> The U.S. is a multicultural society with significant populations of European, African, Asian, and Latin American descent.</li>
          <li><strong>Languages:</strong> While English is the de facto national language, Spanish is widely spoken, and hundreds of other languages are used in communities across the country.</li>
          <li><strong>Age Distribution:</strong> The population is aging, with the median age rising as baby boomers reach retirement and birth rates decline.</li>
          <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Over 80% of Americans live in urban areas, with major metropolitan regions like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago driving economic and cultural trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Educational Attainment:</strong> The U.S. has one of the highest rates of tertiary education attainment among OECD countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This demographic diversity contributes to the country's cultural richness but also presents challenges related to social integration, economic inequality, and political polarization.</p>

          <li><strong>Higher Education:</strong> U.S. universities consistently rank among the world's best, attracting international students and faculty.</li>
          <li><strong>Cuisine:</strong> American food culture reflects its diversity, with regional specialties and fusion cuisines gaining global popularity.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports:</strong> American football, baseball, and basketball have passionate followings both domestically and internationally.</li>
          <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> Silicon Valley and other tech hubs drive global trends in digital culture and communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Literature and Arts:</strong> American authors, artists, and performers have made significant contributions to global culture.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> New York City remains the global center of finance, housing the NYSE and major investment banks.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology and Innovation:</strong> Silicon Valley leads in software, hardware, and internet services, while other regions specialize in biotech, aerospace, and clean energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Despite globalization, the U.S. maintains strong manufacturing capabilities in automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech equipment.</li>
          <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> The U.S. is a major exporter of agricultural products including grains, meat, and dairy.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Recent developments in shale oil and gas have made the U.S. a net energy exporter.</li>
          <li><strong>Services Sector:</strong> Healthcare, retail, education, and professional services account for a growing share of economic activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency, and American consumer markets drive global demand for products and services. However, the economy faces challenges including income inequality, infrastructure needs, and international competition.</p>

        <p>The United States has been at the forefront of technological innovation for decades, with multiple regions specializing in different aspects of technology development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Silicon Valley:</strong> The global epicenter of software development, venture capital, and internet companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Boston-Cambridge Corridor:</strong> A leader in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and academic research.</li>
          <li><strong>Seattle:</strong> Home to major technology and aerospace companies including Microsoft and Amazon.</li>
          <li><strong>Austin and Research Triangle:</strong> Emerging hubs for semiconductors, clean technology, and software development.</li>
          <li><strong>Defense Technology:</strong> Significant investment in defense-related technologies through agencies like DARPA and major defense contractors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>American companies and research institutions lead in critical fields including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and space exploration. The country's innovation ecosystem benefits from strong intellectual property protections, venture capital availability, and collaboration between academia and industry.</p>
        <p>However, maintaining this leadership position requires addressing challenges in STEM education, research funding, and international competition, particularly from China and the European Union.</p>

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>The United States wields significant soft power—the ability to shape preferences and attract others through appeal rather than coercion. This influence operates through multiple channels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Entertainment and Media:</strong> Hollywood films, American television series, and music dominate global popular culture.</li>
          <li><strong>Higher Education:</strong> U.S. universities attract the world's brightest students and scholars, creating global networks of influence.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology Platforms:</strong> American social media, search engines, and software shape how people worldwide communicate and access information.</li>
          <li><strong>Philanthropy:</strong> American foundations and NGOs address global challenges in health, education, and development.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Culture:</strong> American management practices and corporate models influence global business operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Diplomacy and Alliances:</strong> Through international organizations and bilateral relationships, the U.S. promotes its values and interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This soft power enhances American security and economic interests by creating favorable international environments. However, it can be diminished by perceptions of American unilateralism, domestic political divisions, or controversial foreign policies.</p>

          <li><strong>Trade Partnerships:</strong> The U.S. maintains significant trade relationships with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and the European Union.</li>
          <li><strong>Multinational Corporations:</strong> American companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and ExxonMobil operate globally, influencing economic policies worldwide.</li>
          <li><strong>Outsourcing:</strong> Many U.S. companies outsource manufacturing, IT services, and customer support to countries with lower labor costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Markets:</strong> Wall Street serves as the global center for capital markets, with the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency.</li>
          <li><strong>Trade Agreements:</strong> The USMCA (replacing NAFTA) and other bilateral agreements shape regional economic integration.</li>
